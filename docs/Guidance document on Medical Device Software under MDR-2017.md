thus  hardware  (true  hardware,  not  firmware)  and  very  low-level  software
(like Central Processing Unit (CPU) microcode) can be included.
5.0 MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE (MDSW): KEY FEATURES and EXAMPLES
- Not all software used within healthcare settings qualify as a MDSW.
- MDSW  is  increasingly  being  deployed  on  general-purpose  (non-medical
purpose) hardware and delivered, in diverse care settings, on a multitude of
technology  platforms  (e.g.,  personal  computers,  smart  phones,  and  in  the
cloud) that are easily accessible. It is also being increasingly interconnected to
other systems and datasets (e.g., via networks and over the Internet).
- Software intended for any medical purpose in animals shall also be considered
as MDSW.
- In effect, the following types of software are considered as MDSW:
1) Software  that  are  intended  for  any  of  the  medical  purposes  as  defined  in
## Section 4.10.
2) Software that are considered as a “part of” (or,  embedded  in) the  medical
device hardware and/or that drive or influence the use of that medical device,
wherein drive or influence the use of can be referred as:
(i) operate, modify the state of, or control a hardware medical device either
through an interface or via the operator of the device, or/and
(ii) supply output related to the (hardware) functioning of that device.
## NOTE:
i) The  embedded  software/firmware  that  are  required by  a  hardware
medical device to perform the hardware’s medical device intended use
shall be referred to as MDSW. If it is sold separately from the hardware
medical device, a separate licence is required for its
import/manufacturing under the MDR-2017.
ii) A  separate  licence  may  not  be  required  for  software  that  are  a  part
of/embedded and that drive or influence the use of a hardware medical

device. They may be registered/licenced along with the parent medical
device as component/accessories.
iii) Software, including mobile apps/cloud software, that can control or adjust
a  medical  device  through  a  connection,  either  physical  or  utilising
wireless  technology  such  as  Bluetooth  or  Wi--Fi  features,  shall  be
considered as medical devices.
3)  Any software  that  are, either  alone  or  in  combination with  any  other
hardware or software medical device, intended to be used to perform one
or more medical purposes as defined in Section 4.10 without being part of
a hardware medical device, wherein,
“without being part of” means software does not necessarily require a
hardware medical device to achieve its intended medical purpose.
Such software may also be referred to as standalone MDSW.
4) Software that may  be  interfaced with  other  medical  devices (including
hardware medical devices and/or other MDSW) as well as general purpose
software for performing any medical purposes.
## NOTE:
i)  MDSW  may  be  capable  of  running  on  general  purpose  (non-medical
purpose) computing platforms and different operating systems, wherein
“Computing platforms” include  hardware  and  software  resources  (e.g.
operating  system,  processing  hardware,  storage,  software  libraries,
displays, input devices, programming languages, etc.), and,
“Operating systems” refer  to  any  server,  workstation,  mobile  platform,
or any other general-purpose hardware platform  that  may be required
by the software to run on.
ii) Mobile apps, AI/ML-based software and Cloud/Network-based software
that meet the definition stated in Section 4.9 above are considered as

## MDSW.
iii) Commercial off-the-Shelf (COTS) software that meets the definition as
stated in Section 4.9 shall be considered as MDSW. However, if such
software has no  medical  purpose,  then  they may  not fall  under  the
purview of the MDR-2017. If such COTS software is part of the larger
MDSW framework, the manufacturer should submit a
justification/clarification on the role and impact of the COTS software on
the safety and efficacy of the MDSW function.
iv) If an MDSW is part of a system which has other functions that may not
be  medical  purposes  (non-device  functions),  then  such  functions  may
not   be   regulated   or   subject   to   regulatory   review.   However,   the
manufacturer should submit  clarification  on  the  impact  of non-device
functions  on  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  the  MDSW  function for
assessment and review.
- All MDSW can be considered to be active devices because they rely on a source
of energy other than energy generated by the human/animal body or gravity.
5.1 Software that are covered under MDR-2017 (practical illustrations)
Example  (1): The  embedded  software/firmware  in  a  cardiac  pacemaker  is
regulated as a component of that pacemaker, because it is supplied as part of the
device and is necessary for the device to function.
Example  (2): An  embedded  software  that  controls  or  drives  an  insulin  pump  to
deliver a calculated dose of insulin.
Example (3): Software that is built (pre-installed) into an IVD analyser/instrument
(e.g., operating software in a clinical analyser, point of care analyser or personal
use IVD such as a glucose meter). In these cases, the software is a part of a device
and is not considered to be a separate or distinct device.
Example  (4): Software  that  is  supplied  separately  (which  is  installed  on  a

computer  interface)  to  an  IVD  analyzer/instrument  but  intended  to operate  or
influence the IVD. In these cases, the software is a distinct IVD that is separate
from the IVD analyser/instrument.
Example  (5): A  software  application  that  connects  via  Bluetooth  to  a  blood
pressure cuff to obtain readings in order to track blood pressure in the individual
wearing the cuff for medical purposes.
Example (6): A software intended for image analysis of body fluid preparations or
digital slides to perform cell count and morphology reviews.
Example  (7): A Computer  Aided  Detection (CAD)-based  software  intended  to
provide information that may suggest or exclude medical conditions by analyzing
X-ray images or ECGs.
Example (8): An AI/ML-based tool intended for triage, and/or screening of cancer
lesions.
Example (9): A digital platform, using Internet-of-Things (IoT), and intended for use
in  conjunction  with  connected  devices  (like  smart  glucometers)  to  track  chronic
conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, etc., to offer real-time AI-
driven data analytics and interventions to mitigate acute health episodes.
Example  (10): A  behavior-change  and  digital  therapeutics  platform  intended  to
mitigate the progression of chronic diseases (e.g., Type 2 diabetes, hypertension,
etc.) through remote coaching and digital tracking.
Example (11): A software designed for use with veterinary medical purposes, e.g.,
veterinary radiological   image   analysis,   veterinary   medical   device   operation
software, etc.

intended use of the MDSW is normally reflected in various sources such as the
labelling details, including instructions for use manuals, websites, promotional
material, and other information provided by the manufacturer.
7.1 Factors to be considered for risk classification of MDSW
- All MDSW shall  be  classified  using  the  classification  parameters  and
provisions as specified in the First Schedule of the MDR-2017.
- The  intended  use  of  the MDSW as  provided  by  the  manufacturer  shall  be
fundamental to the risk classification of that MDSW.
- In  effect,  software  that  are  intended  for  driving  or  influencing  the  use  of  a
hardware  medical  device shall  be  classified  in  the  same  risk  class  as  the
hardware medical device (e.g., medical device operation software, medical device
image output generation and processing software, etc.).
- Additionally, subject to the parameters laid out in the First Schedule of MDR-
2017  and  as  specified  by  the  intended  use  statement, if  the  MDSW  is
standalone, then Table 2 may be referred for risk classification.
Table 2. Risk classification of MDSW which are standalone.
Note: Standalone MDSW intended to be used by non-clinical users in a "serious situation or condition"
as described here, without the support from specialized professionals, may be considered as a MDSW
used in a "critical situation or condition". It may, hence, influence the risk classification of the MDSW.
- The following factors may be considered in determining the risk class of such
standalone MDSW:
a) Significance  of  information  provided  by the  MDSW for  health  care
decision making, viz. Treatment or diagnosis, Drive clinical management

the  applied  MDSW  may  be considered  as an  IMD/new  IVD and  prior
permission from CLA is required for conducting clinical investigations/clinical
performance evaluation (and for import/manufacturing for marketing) in the
country (Please refer Section 12.2).
(C) Essential Principles of safety and performance
- The   applicant   shall   refer   to   the   Essential   principles   checklist   for
demonstrating  conformity  to  the  essential  principles  of  safety  and
performance of the Medical Device, published on the CDSCO website.
- While  demonstrating  the  conformance  to  the  essential  principles,  the
manufacturer is required to ensure the following for MDSW:
a) The software should be developed, manufactured and maintained in
accordance with the state of the art taking into account the principles
of development life cycle (e.g., rapid development cycles, frequent
changes, the cumulative effect of changes), risk management (e.g.,
changes  to  system,  environment,  and  data),  including  information
security (e.g., safely implement updates), verification and validation
(e.g., change management process).
b) Software  that  is  intended  to  be  used  in  combination  with  mobile
computing platforms should be designed and developed taking into
account the platform itself (e.g. size and contrast ratio of the screen,
connectivity, memory, etc.) and the external factors related to their
use (varying environment as regards level of light or noise).
c) Manufacturers  should  set  out  minimum  requirements  concerning
hardware,  IT  networks  characteristics  and  IT  security  measures,
including protection against unauthorized access, necessary to run
the software as intended.
(D) Risk management
The MDSW are associated with some unique challenges that are generally

## Central Drugs Standard Control Organization,
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India

Page 42 of 62

not evident for other medical devices, which are summarized below:
a) Direct benefit and risks for patients are not always present.
b) Deployed on a multitude of technology/hardware platforms.
c) Interconnected to other systems and datasets.
d) Rapid development cycles and frequent changes.
e) Often an update made available by the manufacturer is left to the user
of the MDSW to install.
f) Deployment at scale and at pace, outside control of manufacturer.
g) Information security with respect to safety considerations (e.g., Cyber
security,  preservation  of  patient  confidentiality  and  privacy,  integrity
and  availability  of  information).  Local  legislation  and  regulations  on
data protection and privacy are required to be complied with.
h) Computer-human interaction.
Considering this, the manufacturers/importers need to consider and comply
with the following:
- Applicable standards such as IS/ISO 14971, IS/ISO 62304, ISO 82304,
etc. need to be followed and complied to (Section 8.0).
- The  risk  management  plan/protocol  should  be  devised  and  the  Risk
Management  Report  generated  by  the  manufacturer  as  per  the  IS/ISO
14971 (and other applicable standards) shall be submitted as part of the
license  application  as  applicable  (see Annexure  A for  submission
requirements).
- The   manufacturer/importer   is   required   to   consider   and   ensure
implementation  of  surveillance/monitoring  mechanisms  for  the  risks
associated  with MDSW,  in  relation  to  injury  or  damage  to  the  health  of
people    and    reduction  of  effectiveness,  wherein  “reduction  of
effectiveness”  can  result  from  inadequate,  incorrect,  or  absent  data
supplied to a human or product at an inappropriate time, rate, or with an
inadequate method.
- The   manufacturers/importers   are   required   to   consider   and   ensure

## Doc No.
## : CDSCO/MD/GD/MDSW/01/2026



## Central Drugs Standard Control Organization,
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India

Page 43 of 62

implementation of surveillance/monitoring mechanisms for indirect harms
associated  with MDSW (e.g.,  introduction  of  unintended  bias  in  clinical
decision-making because of an MDSW output may be considered as an
indirect harm to the patient).
## NOTE:
Indirect harm, for the purpose of this document, refers to patient injury or
health  damage  caused  by  erroneous,  delayed,  or  misleading  software
information,  or  a  reduction  in  device  effectiveness,  rather  than  a  direct
physical failure.
- The  process for  identification  and  analysis  of  these  risks  (including
indirect harms) should be considered iteratively and should be carried out
over the total product lifecycle of the device.
- The  risk  management  process  should  be  integrated  across  the  entire
lifecycle of the MDSW.
- Software   change   management   should   be   ensured   and   properly
documented as part of the risk management plan by the manufacturer.
- Details  on  periodic  updation  of  the MDSW and  corrections/changes
associated with risks should be added in the risk management report.
- In  this  regard,  an  Algorithm  Change  Protocol  (ACP)  may  be  devised,
wherever applicable, based on the nature and risks associated with the
MDSW.  The  ACP  shall  include  an  overview  of  all  the  procedures  to  be
followed  so  that  any  changes/modifications  made  in  the MDSW do  not
compromise  its  safety  and  intended  use.  The  ACP  may  contain  the
following information:
a) A data management plan that includes a data management protocol,
risk  assessment  plan,  new  data  collection  protocols,  and  quality
assurance process.
b) A    performance    evaluation    and    monitoring    plan,    describing
assessment   metrics,   a   statistical   analysis   plan,   assessment
frequency, performance   targets,   and   post   market   monitoring

overview.
c) An  algorithm  retraining  plan  (if  applicable)  to  described  retraining
objectives,  methods  that  will  be  employed  to  improve  algorithm
performance, the approach to performance evaluation, and potential
impacts to intended purpose.
d) A software update plan, describing version tracking, verification and
validation   methods,   update   triggers,   update   procedures,   and
approaches to transparently communicating updates to end users.
e) A rollback plan, describing triggers, backup and recovery procedures,
and communication to users.
- The  ACP  may  be  submitted  as  part  of  the  Risk  Management  File,  if
applicable.
- Risks  associated  with  process  validation  and  benchmarking  should  be
carefully documented and assessed – including the decisions for selecting
specific  datasets,  reference  standards,  parameters  and  metrics  to  justify
such validation processes.
[For example, in case of AI-based SaMD, careful consideration needs to be given
to  documenting how  and  why  specific  data  or  datasets  are  selected  to  train,
externally validate and retrain the model (e.g. post-deployment retraining).]
- The applicants should ideally include details pertaining to the following in
the risk management documentation, wherever applicable:
a) hazard identification,
b) severity/probability analysis,
c) cybersecurity risks,
d) AI bias risks,
e) misuse scenarios,
f) mitigation controls,
g) residual risk analysis.
- Risks associated with MDSW may be mapped as given in Table 7.

Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India

Page 46 of 62

and mitigate cybersecurity risks, particularly for network-connected, cloud-
based, and interoperable MDSW.
- Manufacturers  should  ensure  that  the MDSW  is  delivered  with  secure
default  configurations.  It  should  be  designed  such  that unnecessary
services, ports, interfaces, and debug functions can be disabled by default.
- Further,  manufacturers  should  design  MDSW  to  maintain  safe  operation
during cybersecurity incidents, including partial loss of connectivity, denial-
of-service conditions, or integrity compromise.
System and Software Architecture Design/Diagram:
- Manufacturers may  ensure  that  a  security-focused  architecture  review  of
MDSW  is  conducted.  Such  review  should  include  identification  and
assessment  of  attack  surfaces,  trust  boundaries,  external  interfaces,
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and interoperability points, to
ensure that all potential cyber entry points are systematically identified and
appropriately controlled.
- As part of technical documentation, detailed depiction of functional units
and software modules may be submitted. Such depiction  should  include
state diagrams as well as flow charts to present a roadmap of the device
design to facilitate a clear understanding of:
a) The modules and layers that make up the system and software.
b) The relationships among the modules and layers.
c) How  users  or  external  products,  including  IT  infrastructure  and
peripherals (e.g. wirelessly connected medical devices) interact with
the system and software.
d) How  users  or  external  products,  including  IT  infrastructure  and
peripherals  (e.g.,  wirelessly  connected  medical  devices)  interact
with the system and software.
[Example:  A  module  could  represent – a  finished  hardware  device  within  a
system  of  hardware  and  software  products,  a  hardware  component  within  a
finished  hardware  device,  a  finished  software  product  within  a  system  of

software products, or a software function within a finished software product. A
module is not specifically meant to describe code-level software functions.]
- Where  MDSW  systems (including  AI-based  systems) create,  process,
exchange, analyze, or display patient health information, developers and
implementers  should  align  with  the  Ayushman  Bharat  Digital  Mission
(ABDM)  framework  by  supporting  interoperable,  standards-based  data

- The  applicants  are  required  to  submit  a  post-market  surveillance (PMS)
plan proportionate to the risk class of the device.
- The PMS activities that manufacturers should follow include:
a) Complaint handling,
b) Adverse event reporting,
c) Software patch tracking,
d) Drift monitoring for AI,
e) Cybersecurity monitoring,
f) Field corrective actions.
- Corrections and corrective actions may be required when a process is not
correctly followed or the MDSW does not meet its specified requirements
(i.e., when a nonconforming process or product exists).
- Non-conforming MDSW should be contained to prevent unintended use
or delivery. The detected nonconformity should be analyzed and actions
taken  to  eliminate  the  detected  nonconformity  (i.e.,  correction);  and  to
identify  and  eliminate  the  cause(s)  of  the  detected  nonconformity  (i.e.,
corrective action) to prevent recurrence of the detected nonconformity in
the  future.  In  some  cases,  a  potential  nonconformity  may  be  identified,
and actions  such  as  safeguards and  process  changes  can be  taken,  to
prevent nonconformities from occurring (i.e., preventive action).
- Nonconformities  in  a MDSW may  lead  to  inaccurate  or  incorrect  test
results, mixing up of patient results, failure to deliver therapy, calibration
errors  resulting  in  incorrect  patient  positioning  during  therapy,  incorrect
image  display,  calculation  errors,  software  bugs  leading  to  malfunction,
etc.
- AI-based MDSW should be continuously monitored for performance, bias,
and drift, which may lead to nonconformities. Proper documentation and
logging of such events should be maintained.
- For  AI/ML-based  or  adaptive  systems,  the  plan should  ideally include
mechanisms for monitoring:

a) Model performance drift
b) Error rates and false outputs
c) Clinical safety signals
d) User feedback integration
- A detailed procedure/plan should be devised for post-market surveillance
(PMS)  and  response.  The  manufacturer/importer  needs  to  ensure  that
they have the ability to handle product recalls and implement corrective
actions  (e.g.  bug  fixes,  cyber  alerts,  software  patches)  in  a  timely  and
effective  manner  (Planning,  conducting  and  reporting  of  corrective
action), and to identify any recurring problems requiring attention.
- The licence holder should ensure that mechanisms are implemented for
collection  of real-world  evidence  (RWE) from  Indian  healthcare  settings
as part of PMS.
- A  Field  Safety  Corrective  Action  (FSCA)  may  be  initiated  when  the
manufacturer/importer  becomes  aware  of  such  nonconformities/certain
risks  associated  with use of the MDSW through  post-market monitoring
and surveillance, such as through tracking of product
complaints/feedback.
- Adverse events (AE) for MDSW may arise due to:
a) Shortcomings in the design of the software
b) Inadequate verification and validation of the software code
c) Inadequate instructions for use
d) Software bugs introduced during implementation of new features
e) Drift in AI algorithm which may affect its performance.
- The license holder shall inform the SLA or the CLA, as the case may be,
of  the  occurrence  of  any suspected  unexpected  serious  adverse  event
(SUSAR) and action taken thereon including any product recall within 15
days of such event coming to the notice of the license holder.
- The  importer  shall  inform  the  Licensing  Authority,  within  a  period  of  15
days of  any  administrative  action  taken  on  account  of  any  adverse

reaction, such as market withdrawal, regulatory restrictions, cancellation
of authorization or declaration of the MDSW as not of standard quality by
the  regulatory  authority  of  the  country  of  origin  or  by  any  regulatory
authority of any other country, where the medical device is marketed, sold
or distributed.
- The manufacturer/importer shall immediately inform SLA or CLA, as the
case may be, if there are reasons to believe that a MDSW which has been
placed in the market, may be unsafe for the patients, wherein unsafe in
terms  of MDSW refers  to  erroneous  results  leading  to  negative  impact
(whether direct or indirect) on patient health or/and introduction of bias in
clinical  decision-making  to  the  extent  that  it  may  negatively  impact  the
health of user.
[Examples:  malfunction  of  an  implanted  pulse  generator  because  of  erroneous
control/influence by the respective software; erroneous calculations in radiation
therapy planning leading to exposure to incorrect radiation intensities, etc.].
- A summary of required documentation is provided in Table 8.
